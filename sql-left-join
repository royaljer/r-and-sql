##Using a dataset from IMDB, I used a left join to find all actors (+ director) who were involved
##in the first two "Godfather" movies. In PostgreSQL you could use the INTERSECT function, but as this
##is not available in all RDMS' I prefer to use JOIN.

SELECT *
FROM (SELECT movies.title, people.name, role_type.role, cast_info.person_id AS gf2id
FROM cast_info
JOIN movies ON cast_info.movie_id=movies.id AND movies.id='2458108'
JOIN people ON cast_info.person_id=people.id 
JOIN role_type ON cast_info.role_id=role_type.id) AS gf2
LEFT JOIN (SELECT cast_info.person_id AS gf1id
FROM cast_info
             JOIN movies on cast_info.movie_id=movies.id AND movies.id='2458086'
             JOIN people on cast_info.person_id=people.id) AS gf1 ON gf1id=gf2id
             WHERE gf1id IS NOT NULL
