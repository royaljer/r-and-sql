##Using a dataset from IMDB, I used a left join to find all actors (+ director) who were involved
##in the first two "Godfather" movies. In PostgreSQL you could use the INTERSECT function, but as this
##is not available in all RDBMS' I prefer to use JOIN and a subquery.

SELECT p.name, r.role, ci.person_id AS cipid
FROM cast_info ci JOIN people p ON p.id = ci.person_id
JOIN role_type r ON r.id = ci.role_id 
WHERE ci.movie_id = 2458108 AND ci.person_id IN
  (SELECT ci.person_id
  FROM cast_info ci JOIN people p ON p.id = ci.person_id
  JOIN role_type r ON r.id = ci.role_id 
  WHERE ci.movie_id = 2458086)
